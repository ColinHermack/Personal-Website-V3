title: 'Purdue Outing Club Website (V2)'
completedOn: '2024-12-31'
summary: 'A more modern and streamlined version of the Purdue Outing Club website.'
---

This is a currently in-progress project with several goals. I am migrating the Purdue Outing Club site from a primarily static HTML site written in Express on the backend and occasionally React on the frontend to 
a more modern NextJS site. This should have the effect of simplifying future development, streamlining the codebase, and improving search engine optimization. Moving to
Vercel for deployment will also simplify the deployment process and save money. The database is currently unchanged since we have no complaints with PostgreSQL.

## Tech Stack
NextJS, ReactJS, TailwindCSS, PostgreSQL, Vercel, AWS, Typescript
